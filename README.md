# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. In this project, I had access to approximately 50 datasets, and chsoe to analyze the Video Game Reviews Dataset. I used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transformed the data, connected to an AWS RDS instance, and loaded the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, I used PySpark, to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.

## Results
Below are the results of the analysis performed:

* Number of Vine reviews 

* Number of non-Vine reviews

* Number of Vine reviews with 5 stars

* Number of non-Vine reviews with 5 stars

* Percentage of Vine reviews with 5 stars
